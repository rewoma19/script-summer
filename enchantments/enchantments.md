# Instructions

As a magician-to-be, Elyse needs to practice some basics. She has a stack of cards that she wants to manipulate.

To make things a bit easier, she only uses the cards 1 to 10 so her stack of cards can be represented by an array of numbers. The position of a certain card corresponds to the index in the array. That means position 0 refers to the first card, postion 1 to the second card, etc.

**Note**
All but two functions should update the array of cards and then return the modified array - a common way of working known as the Builder pattern, which allows you to nicely daisy-chain functions together.

The two exceptions are **getItem** which should return the card at the given position, and **checkSizeOfStack** which should return **true** if the given size matches.

## Task 1

### Retrieve a card from a stack

To pick a card, return the card at index **position** from the given stack

## Task 2

### Exchange a card in the stack

Perform some sleight of hand and exchange the card at index **postion** with the replacement card provided, Return the adjusted stack.

## Task 3

### Insert a card at the top of the stack

Make a card appear by inserting a new card at the top of the stack. Return the adjusted stack
