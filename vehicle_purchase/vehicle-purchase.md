# Instructions

In this exercise, you will write some code to help you prepare to buy a vehicle.

You have three tasks, one to determine if you will need to get a license, one to help you choose between two vehicles and one to estimate the acceptable price for a used vehicle.

## Task 1

### Determine if you will need a drivers license

Some kinds of vehicles require a drivers license to operate them. Assume only the kinds **'car'** and **'truck'** require a license, everything else can be operated without a license.

Implement the **needsLicense(kind)** function that takes the kind of vehicle and returns a boolean indicating whether you need a license for that kind of vehicle.
