# Instructions

In this exercise, you will write some code to help you prepare to buy a vehicle.

You have three tasks, one to determine if you will need to get a license, one to help you choose between two vehicles and one to estimate the acceptable price for a used vehicle.

## Task 1

### Determine if you will need a drivers license

Some kinds of vehicles require a drivers license to operate them. Assume only the kinds **'car'** and **'truck'** require a license, everything else can be operated without a license.

Implement the **needsLicense(kind)** function that takes the kind of vehicle and returns a boolean indicating whether you need a license for that kind of vehicle.

## Task 2

### Choose between two potential vehicles to buy

You evaluate your options of available vehicles. You manage to narrow it down to two options but you need help making the final decision. For that, implement the function **chooseVehicle(option1, option2)** that takes two vehicles as arguments and returns a decision that includes the option that comes first in dictionary order.
