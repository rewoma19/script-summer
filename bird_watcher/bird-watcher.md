# Instructions

You are an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden. Usually, you use a tally in a notebook to count the birds but you want to better work with your data. You already digitalized the bird counts per day for the past weeks that you kept in the notebook.

Now you want to determine the total number of birds that you counted, calculate the bird count for a specific week and correct a counting mistake.

> Note: To practice, use a **for** loop to solve each task

## Task 1

### Determine the total number of birds that you counted so far

Let us start analyzing the data by getting a high-level view. Find out how many birds you counted in total since you started your logs.
Implement a function **totalBirdCount** that accepts an array that contains the bird count per day. It should return the total number of birds that you counted.

## Task 2

### Calculate the number of visiting birds in a specific week

Now that you got a general feel for your bird count numbers, you want to make a more fine-grained analysis.

Implement a function **birdsInWeek** that accepts an array of bird counts per day and a week number. It returns the total number of birds that you counted in that specific week. You can assume weeks are always tracked completely.
