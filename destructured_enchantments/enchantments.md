# Instructions

Elyse, magician-to-be, continues her training. She has a deck of cards she wants to manipulate.

To male things easier, she usually only starts with cards numbered 2 to 10, although some of the tricks may involve additional (face) cards.

## Task 1

### Get the first card

Elyse will summon the first card in the deck without using the **array[index]**, **.at(index)**, or **.shift()**. It's just like magic.

## Task 2

### Get the second card

Elyse performs sleight of hand and summons the second card in the deck without using the **array[index]** or **.shif()**.

## Task 3

### Swap two cards

Elyse will make the two cards of the deck switch places. She doesn't need to call a single function.

## Task 4

### Shift three cards around

In order to perform some more sleight of hand, Elyse takes three cards and quickly moves the top card to the back, making the middle card the first card and the old bottom card the middle card. She doesn't need to call a single function.

## Task 5

### Pick the named pile

Elyse will separate the deck into two piles. She then asks the observer to pick one of the two piles, which we'll name **chosen**. The **disregarded** pile is no longer relevant, which she makes disappear. She doesn't need to call a single function.

## Task 6

### Swap the picked pile

Unfortunately, the observer keeps picking the "wrong" pile, but with some clever fast magic, Elyse renames the **chosen** pile to be **disregarded** and the **disregarded** pile to be the **chosen** pile. She doesn't need to call a single function.
