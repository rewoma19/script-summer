# Instructions

Elyse, magician-to-be, continues her training. She has a deck of cards she wants to manipulate.

To male things easier, she usually only starts with cards numbered 2 to 10, although some of the tricks may involve additional (face) cards.

## Task 1

### Get the first card

Elyse will summon the first card in the deck without using the **array[index]**, **.at(index)**, or **.shift()**. It's just like magic.
