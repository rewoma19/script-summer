# Instructions

Your friend Kojo is a big fan of numbers. He has a small website called 'fun-with-numbers'. Kojo is not that good at programming so he asked you for help.

You will build two helper functions for new number games on Kojo's website and a third one to validate some input the user can enter.

## Task 1

### Calculate the sum for the numbers on the slot machine

One of the games on Kojo's website looks like a slot machine that shows two groups of wheels with digits on them. Each group of digits represents a number. For the game mechanics, Kojo needs to know the sum of those two numbers.

Write a function **twoSum** that accepts two arrays as parameters. Each array consists of one or more numbers between 0 and 9. The function should interpret each array as a numbers between 0 and 9. The function should interpret each array as a number and return the sum of those two numbers.
