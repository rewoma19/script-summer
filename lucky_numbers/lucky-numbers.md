# Instructions

Your friend Kojo is a big fan of numbers. He has a small website called 'fun-with-numbers'. Kojo is not that good at programming so he asked you for help.

You will build two helper functions for new number games on Kojo's website and a third one to validate some input the user can enter.

## Task 1

### Calculate the sum for the numbers on the slot machine

One of the games on Kojo's website looks like a slot machine that shows two groups of wheels with digits on them. Each group of digits represents a number. For the game mechanics, Kojo needs to know the sum of those two numbers.

Write a function **twoSum** that accepts two arrays as parameters. Each array consists of one or more numbers between 0 and 9. The function should interpret each array as a numbers between 0 and 9. The function should interpret each array as a number and return the sum of those two numbers.

## Task 2

### Determine if a number is a palindrome

Another game on the website is a little quiz called "Lucky Numbers". A user can enter a number and then sees whether the number belongs to some secret sequence or pattern. The sequence or pattern of the "lucky numbers" changes each month and each user only has a limited number of tries to guess it.

This months' lucky numbers should be numbers that are palindromes. Palindromic numbers remain the same when the digits are reversed.

Implement the new **luckyNumber** function that accepts a number as a parameter. The function should return **true** if the number is a palindrome and **false** otherwise. The input number will always be a positive integer.
