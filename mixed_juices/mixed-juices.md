Your friend Li Mei runs a juice bar where she sells delicious mixed fruit juices. You are a frequent customer in her shop and realized you could make your friend's life easier. You decide to use your coding skills to help Li Mei with her job.

## Task 1

### Determine how long it takes to mix a juice

Li Mei likes to tell her customers in advance how long they have to wait for a juice from the menu that they ordered. She has a hard time remembering the exact numbers because the time it takes to mix the juices varies.
**'Pure Strawberry Joy'** takes 0.5 minutes, **'Energizer'** and **'Green Garden'** takes 1.5 minutes each, **'Tropical Island'** takes 3 minutes and **'All or Nothing'** takes 5 minutes. For all other drinks (e.g special offers) you can assume a preparation time of 2.5 minutes.
To help your friend, write a function **timeToMixJuice** that takes a juice from the menu as an argument and returns the number of minutes it takes to mix that drink.
