# Instructions

As a budding magician, Elyse needs to analyze her deck in lots of different ways. To keep things simple, she only uses cards with values 1-10.

## Task 1

### Determine how many cards of a certain type are in the deck

Elyse wants to know how many cards of a particular type she has in her deck.

Write a function **cardTypeCheck** that takes two parameters: an array of cards (Elyse's deck) and the type of card to count.

    **Note**: The function should use **forEach** and return the number of cards in the deck of the specified type.

    const cardType = 3;
    cardTypeCheck([1, 2, 3, 4], cardType);
    // => 1
