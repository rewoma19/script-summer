# Instructions

Elyse, magician-to-be, continues her training. She will be given a deck of cards and attempt to transform the deck. She will make certain cards appear, disapper, change their values, or completely rearrange themselves. To make things easier, she usually only starts with cards numbered 1 to 10, although some of the tricks may result in larger cards being created.

## Task 1

### Double every single card

Elyse wants to double the number of every card in the deck. This may result in higher cards than 1-10.

    const deck = [1, 2, 3, 4, 10];
    seeingDouble(deck);
    // => [2, 4, 6, 8, 20]
